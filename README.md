# FINAL-PROJECT-
AI-Driven Water Quality Predictor for Safe Drinking Water (SDG 6)

📌 Project Overview

This project leverages machine learning to predict whether water is safe for drinking using chemical features. It addresses SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) by offering communities a low-cost, AI-powered water quality checker.

🎯 SDG Focus

Goal: SDG 6 – Clean Water and Sanitation

Problem: Many communities lack real-time, affordable tools to check water safety, leading to preventable waterborne diseases.


🧠 AI Approach

Automation: Machine Learning classification model automates water safety prediction.

Testing: Unit and accuracy tests applied to validate model performance.

Scalability: Modular and lightweight code that can run on low-resource devices.


Technical Solution

Trained a Random Forest Classifier on a public dataset (from Kaggle) with features like pH, hardness, solids, and sulfate to predict potability.

🛠️ Tools & Frameworks

AI/ML: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy

Dev Tools: Git, Google Colab, Jupyter

Deployment: Streamlit (for web app)

Dataset: Kaggle Water Potability Dataset


✅ Deliverables

Python scripts and Jupyter notebook with code and visualizations

Streamlit app for users to input values and receive predictions

Project report including SDG alignment and ethical review


🔍 Ethical & Sustainability Considerations

Checked dataset for balance and fair representation

Optimized model to reduce computation and energy usage

Built for compatibility with offline environments or mobile integration
